# JavaBoneace

A simple Java version of the game of 31. Similar to Blackjack, the object is to get the highest card total without
going over 31 (as opposed to 21 in BJ). The player may request to 'hit' (be given another card) or 'stay' (stick with
the cards they currently have). If the player 'busts' (goes over 31), the computer automatically wins. The converse is
also true. Program features an interactive GUI as well, with 'real' cards (as you might remember from playing cardgames
on old Windows machines!)
